# Distributed Pattern Cache

## Purpose
Define how Redis 7.x clustering will be used for microsecond-access caching of fractal patterns.

## Expected Deliverables
- Redis cluster configuration samples
- Cache interface under `fts/cache/`
- Example integration with the enhanced pipeline

## Integration Steps
1. Implement caching utilities in `fts/cache/` using `redis-py` or `aioredis`.
2. Provide deployment instructions for Redis cluster.
3. Document usage and failover strategies in `docs/`.

## Affected Areas
- `fts/cache/`
- Deployment scripts
- Documentation under `docs/`
