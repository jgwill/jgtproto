# Vector Similarity Database

## Purpose
Describe how vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) will store embeddings of fractal patterns for similarity search.

## Expected Deliverables
- Service configuration and connection utilities
- Example embedding pipeline for pattern data
- Query helpers for nearest-neighbor searches

## Integration Steps
1. Implement vector DB interface under `fts/vector_db/`.
2. Document embedding model requirements in `docs/`.
3. Provide example usage in `examples/`.

## Affected Areas
- `fts/vector_db/`
- `examples/`
- Documentation under `docs/`
