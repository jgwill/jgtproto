# Reinforcement Learning Components

## Purpose
Outline how RL modules will track signal validity and optimize parameters.

## Expected Deliverables
- RL agent classes with configurable reward functions
- Training scripts and evaluation notebooks

## Integration Steps
1. Implement agents under `fts/rl/`.
2. Provide example training run in `examples/`.
3. Update documentation describing reward structure.

## Affected Areas
- `fts/rl/`
- `examples/`
- Docs and tutorials
