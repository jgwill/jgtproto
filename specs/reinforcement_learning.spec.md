# Reinforcement Learning Components

## Purpose
Outline how RL modules will track signal validity, optimize parameters over time, and evaluate multi-indicator strategies using reinforcement learning.

## Expected Deliverables
- RL agent classes with configurable reward functions (initial Q-learning implementation provided)
- Parameter optimization utilities
- Weighted multi-indicator evaluation system
- Training scripts and evaluation notebooks

## Integration Steps
1. Implement agents under `fts/rl/`.
2. Provide example training run in `examples/`.
3. Define state representation modules shared across agents.
4. Update documentation describing reward structure.

## Affected Areas
- `fts/rl/`
- `examples/`
- Docs and tutorials
- Shared config files
