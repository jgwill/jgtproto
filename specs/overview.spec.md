# FTS Integration Overview

This repository acts as the main integration hub for the Fractal Trading System (FTS). A companion repository will supply concrete implementations such as database schemas and reinforcement learning modules. Incoming contributions should follow the specifications documented here.

## Expected Incoming Components
- Database models and migration scripts
- Reinforcement learning agents and training pipelines
- Practical trading strategies and backtests
- Jupyter Book documentation sources
- UI components built with React and Vite

Each spec under `specs/` describes how these components will slot into the existing scaffold under `fts/` and `frontend/`. Contributors should update the relevant spec when adding new features to keep the integration plan accurate.
