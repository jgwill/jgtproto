# FTS Integration Overview

This repository serves as the main integration point for the Fractal Trading System (FTS). The companion repository will provide detailed implementations for database schemas, reinforcement learning, use cases, documentation, and the 7-step trading process.

Each spec under `specs/` outlines expected deliverables and integration steps for incoming contributions. New code should target the `fts/` Python package and the `frontend/` React app when UI components are involved.

Contributors are encouraged to reference these specs and update them as features evolve.
