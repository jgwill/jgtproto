# Practical Use Cases Implementation

## Purpose
Define automated trading strategies using fractal geometry across timeframes and create backtesting and real-time scanning tools that leverage reinforcement learning and pattern recognition modules.

## Expected Deliverables
- Strategy modules implementing pattern detection
- Backtesting framework with sample datasets
- Real-time scanner utilities
- Example integrations with RL agents

## Integration Steps
1. Add strategies under `fts/strategies/`.
2. Implement backtests in `fts/backtest/` using historical data.
3. Provide CLI entrypoints for market scanning.
4. Illustrate how strategies interface with RL agents for decision making.

## Affected Areas
- `fts/strategies/`
- `fts/backtest/`
- Command-line tools
- Reinforcement learning modules
