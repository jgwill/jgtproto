# Seven-Step Process

## Purpose
Outline the end-to-end workflow from data collection to continuous learning for the trading system.

## Expected Deliverables
- Code modules for each step under `fts/`
- Example notebooks demonstrating workflow

## Integration Steps
1. Implement step modules (`data`, `features`, `perspective`, `training`, `signals`, `execution`, `feedback`).
2. Provide pipeline orchestration script.
3. Document each step in the Jupyter Book.

## Affected Areas
- `fts/`
- `examples/`
